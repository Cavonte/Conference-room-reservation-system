A few update for the presentation.

I added teh day passed thing. So now you cant click on a timeslot that is in the past. It prints a message when you try to click on it.

I added a new quote at the beginning, tell me what you think.

Like I said I managed to get 115 frame lost at some point, so the efficiency increase in Oncreate view was not so effective.

I added a runnable function which refreshes the reservation and the wailtlist in mainactivity and waitlist activity, it does the refresh every 30 sec.
If the server keeps crashhing then just comment them out. (thread.start at line 213 in waitlist activity, 212 in mainActivity) This will stop the thread from starting.

After implementing all these, I tested the main functionalities again i.e. adding a reservation, deleting a reservation, modifying a reservation, deleting waitlist

I didnt try append to waitlist but it should work since I tried modify reservation ( by switching to a waitlist)


The notification thing is fined, it popped randomly because we were trying to reserve days that were in the past.


Everything should be fine. I think what is missing is the whole server proofing thing where the arrays that are no test for null will crash the app if the server crash.
